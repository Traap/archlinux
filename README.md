These are notes I maintain while I am setting up a [MacBook Pro (17-inch,
Early 2011) system](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP621).  The
[sysem's](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP621) original disk drive was replaced
with a [Crucial 1T SSD](https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/storage-ssd-mx500).

Notes have been categorized in the order I took them and suggest you follow them.

1. [Installing Arch Linux from a Bootable USB](01-install-arch-linux.md)
1. [Your new Arch Linux Sytem](02-your-new-arch-linux-system.md)
1. [Personalizing Arch Linux](03-personalize-arch-linux.md)
