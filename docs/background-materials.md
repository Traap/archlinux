#### Background materials
Background materials are not prerequisites.  They are certinaly not needed by
[Arch Linux experts](https://www.archlinux.org), but they were useful to me.

I have alreday been asked "Why are you doing this?", and "Why didn't you use
another distrubtion?".  The answer to both of this questions is quite simple,
I wanted to learn somthing new and didn't mind invensting time in my profession
and hobby.

**Note:** I single this video out because it solved my boot problem.

Let me explain.  I followed guides, YouTube, read a lot of documentation, etc.
but I could never get my [MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011)
system](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP621) boot.  I though I had screwed.
I repead my experiments over an entire weekend.  Afer I was completely
frustrated, I took my [Crucial 1T SSD](www.curcial.com) hard drive, and into
a USB drive on my [Mac Pro Workstation 2009)[https://support.apple.com/kb/SP621) 
and powered the sytem on.  I had plan to reformat my [Crucial 1T
SSD](www.curcial.com) thinking I had screwed somthing up. What happened next
supprised me ....

Tangent for suspence ... 

I worked on my [RC10 B6.1 Team Kit (Remote Control Race Car)](https://www.associatedelectrnics.com/teamassociated/cars_and_trucsk/RC10B.1/Team)
for a while.  I returned my [Mac Pro Workstation 2009](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP621) and 
had a hardware failure. I was staring at **BLACK** sceen.  Then I noticed the upper lefthand
corner of my screen, it read `Arch Linux root: `.

Bottom line __Don't Use GRUB__ on a [MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) system](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP621).

I repeated all instructions and used video listed above to resovle my boot issues.
