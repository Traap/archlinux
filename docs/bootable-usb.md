#### Make a bootable USB
* Download [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher)
* Launch balenaEtcher dmg and follow instructions.
* Download an [Arch Linux ISO](https://www.archlinux.org/download)
* Insert a USB stick.
* Run balenaEtcher and select the Arch Linux ISO you downloaded.
* Flash It
* Now you have a bootable Arch Linux USB stick.

__Notes:__
* These instructions are for OSX.  Windows Users' mileage may very.
* The USB stick you use will be completely erased and become bootable.
* OSX complained about the USB stick not being *readable* after _balenaEtcher_ completed the flashing operation.  I was able to insert the USB stick into my target machine and boot from it.
