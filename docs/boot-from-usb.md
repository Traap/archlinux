#### Boot from USB
__Note:__ You are formally advised to follow these instructions **at your own
peril**. I am attempting to install [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) on
a [MacBook Pro (17-inch, Early 2011) system](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP621).
I am **not** using virtualizaiton.  All instructions are being applied directly
to my hardware.

* Insert USB with Arch Linux ISO
* Connect physical Ethernet cable
* Press power button
* Hold Options key when gray screen appears
* Select Arch Linux ISO
* Follow all on-screen instructions.
