__Traap__ is my primary  [World of Warcraft](https://www.worldofwaraft.com)
tune.  Traap is a warrior.  He is fearless.  He never backs down.  He never
quits. He never surrenders.  He steps into the line of fire.  He is loyal.
He is faithful.  He is loving.  He is reverant.  He is courteous.  He is
a comrade.  He is patrioc.  He oozes integrity.  He is trustworthy.  He
trusts the _shed blood of Jesus Chist_ for his soul.  He is everything
I stive to be.
