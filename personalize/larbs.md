* Use your wired ethernet connection 
* `curl -LO larbs.xyz/larbs.sh`
* `sh larbs.sh``
* I suggest creating a user _cj_
  * LARBS will create the user
  * Ask you to confirm the password
  * And ask you to re-confirm the paddword
* About 20min from now you will have a fully functional Arch Linux machine.
