[Luke's Auto-Rice Bootstraping Scripts (LARBS)](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS)

* Use your wired ethernet connection 
* `curl -LO larbs.xyz/larbs.sh`
* `sh larbs.sh``
* I suggest creating a user _cj_
  * LARBS will create the user
  * Ask you to confirm the password
  * And ask you to re-confirm the password
* About 20min from now you will have a fully functional
  [LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS) inspired Arch Linux machine.
