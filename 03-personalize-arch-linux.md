__Notes:__
  * [Luke's Auto-Rice Bootstraping Scripts (LARBS)](personalize/larbs.md) LARBS
    is very cool.  I'm using I3 to build upto LARBS so I understand all the
    steps.
  
 * I experimentd with [linux-macbook
   aur](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&SeB=nd&K=linux-macbook&outdated=&SB=n&SO=a&PP=50&do_Search=Go).
   It worked.  Everything compiled and seamed to work fine.  I completely rebuilt my machine and whiped my disk.
   I have not reused this package, but I keep the link to remind myself it is available.
